# Introduction
Pneumonia is a lung disease that inflames the air sacs in the lungs and could be fatal to children and the elderly. Nowadays, medical application of deep learning is popular to relieve the problem of shortage of doctors.

In this project, two CNN models will be built for classifying the healthy lungs and infected lungs. The first model is built from sketch and the second model is built by transform learning of a pre-trained model.

After building the models, we will perform fine-tuning to the models by different techniques, like early stopping, learning rate schedule, unfreezing pretrained layers, etc.
